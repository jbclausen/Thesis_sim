Why is the flow moving so fast? 
    gradient too steep 
    equation for finding velocity is wrong 

Why is the flow seemingly spreading at constant rate? 
    choosing gradients that are "reasonable" therefore the average is being left out 
    equation for finding velocity is wrong 
    lack of sink rate affects pressure distribution and therefore the flow 
        how can I add the sink rate again?

Post March 26th Sim: 
    The sim definitely needs a sink rate. 
    use multiple_sinks to do this 
    How to choose a sink rate? 
        - use the one from the dry out sim (segment_case_dry_out) and see what happens?
